  This is a project that aims to practice making websites.

## Main Page
  This is the main page when you launch Python. You can click the left button for the articles or the right button to log in. There is also a navigation bar that you can use to turn to other pages.

## Issue an article
  You can issue an article on this page. The first part is the topic, followed by the context, then, you can choose which category it should be.
  Notice that, in `main.py`, line 9 and 10, you can put your email and your password. People who post an article will receive an email from that account, telling them that they have successfully posted the article.
```py
SMTP_SERVER = 'smtp.gmail.com'  
SMTP_PORT = 587  
SENDER_EMAIL = 'yourmail@com'  #put your email here
SENDER_PASSWORD = 'yourpassowrd'  #and password
```

## Category 
  After posting an article, you can see it in its category. You can scroll and take a look at whatever attracts you.

That's pretty much all this project does.
